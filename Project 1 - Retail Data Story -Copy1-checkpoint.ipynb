    "The manager at the Secondhand Rose Resale Shop wants to increase sales.  He decided that having a seven-day sale during which the price of any unsold item drops 10 percent each day would do the trick. (His variables are Customer, Item Number, Original Price, Quantity(implied)\n",

    "His employees don't like the idea.  Its alot of work for them to remember the new prices every day, not to mention changing the price on each item sold.   Before implementing the 7-day sale, the employees want the sales data to be analyzed.  They believe that their customers shop at Secondhand Rose for reasons beside price and that these factors are more important to the customers than a discounted price.  Besides they argue - this sale strategy will result in 6 days of virtually no sales because customers will wait until Day 7 to make their purchases.\n",
